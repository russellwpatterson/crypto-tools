Crypto Tools
============

## Overview ##
Just a couple of .NET clones of Linux utilities.
* `md5sum` - compute the MD5 hash of a file.
* `sha256sum` - compute the SHA256 hash of a file.

## Install ##
I just put `md5sum` and `sha256sum` into my Windows directory and then use them from the command line. You could store them elsewhere and add that folder to the path as well.
